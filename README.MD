We have observed that the new generation kidsâ€™ point of view is more inclined towards the technological development of society only ignoring the secondary factors which are impacting environment in negative ways. Rather it is wastage of their domestic products, wastage of food or making green fields as their playgrounds
Our solution will work as a bridge between learning phase and early age phase of kids in which they shall definitely have an idea about the environment
We have found that NGOs and govt. organizations are struggling to spread awareness messages to the people around and many of them fails badly as well. Our solution will be platform for the NGOs to spread their words and bring the families together under a tree on weekends to encourage kids and parents to be more creative, more social and more close to the nature.
